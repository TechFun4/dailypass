# Dailypass Generator

## Our Goal

Occasionally, the official LAUSD dailypass generator <a href="https://dailypass.lausd.net" title="Official Dailypass Generator" target="_blank">here</a> fails to work. We aim to help students avoid losing precious learning time due to the long entrance lines caused by LAUSD's failure to maintain their website.

## Disclaimer

We do not own the actual design of the dailypass (the dailypass belongs to its respective owner, LAUSD). Our sole goal is to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on the learening experience of LAUSD students and to support charity foundations.

## Profits?

All revenue generated by the Dailypass Generator will be donated to charity foundations. Thank you for your support!

## Can't I Still Make a Daily Pass Even Though I Tested Positive?

We collect as minimal data as possible, and hence we do not have access to your COVID-19 test results. Therefore, we run by an honors policy, but we kindly encourage you to stay home if this is the case.
